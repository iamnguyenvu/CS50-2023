You would calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability of these songs. These values can give you insights into the overall mood and vibe of the listener's music taste.


Consider the limitations of simply averaging the energy, valence, and danceability values of the top 100 songs. Some potential issues could include:
Outliers: A few extremely high or low values could disproportionately affect the average.
Genre Bias: Different genres may have different typical values for energy, valence, and danceability.
Song Length: Longer or shorter songs may skew the results.
